- Introduction to Shortest Path Visualizer

  - Moving through complex mazes or finding the shortest route between two points often involves using complex algorithms. The "Shortest Path Visualizer" project uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm to dynamically compute and display optimal routes on a grid-based interface. This interactive tool allows users to create barriers, create mazes, and visualize step-by-step pathfinding solutions.

- Key Features:

 - BFS and Dijkstra's Algorithm: Implements both algorithms to compute the shortest path efficiently.
 - Interactive Grid: Users can create obstacles and simulate various scenarios.
 - Maze Generation: Option to generate randomized mazes for challenging pathfinding scenarios.
 - Tutorial and Guidance: Includes a built-in tutorial to guide users on how to utilize the interface effectively.
 - Explore the world of pathfinding algorithms with our "Shortest Path Visualizer," where you can learn, experiment, and visualize optimal routes in a user-friendly environment.
